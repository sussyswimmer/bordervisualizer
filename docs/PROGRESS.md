# Progress

## Lane A — Codex

- [ ] C1 FFT, Hann window, band analyzer, auto-gain, envelopes
- [ ] C2 Spectral-flux beat detector, silence detection, `AnalyzerDiagnostics`, `AudioTuning`, real `IAudioAnalyzer` + zero-alloc test
- [ ] C3 `Rimlight.Bench` console + `tools/wav-analyze`: reads a WAV, runs the analyzer offline, prints beat timestamps/BPM, and writes a CSV and a PNG plot (ScottPlot or SkiaSharp) of Level/Bass/Beat/flux/threshold. Include a synthetic-track generator (kicks at a given BPM + noise + vocals-ish sines). **This lets beat tuning happen without Windows.**
- [ ] C4 Oklab/OkLCh, k-means palette extractor, glow-ify, gamut mapping, procedural test fixtures
- [ ] C5 `PaletteBlender` + gradient LUT fill (zero-alloc)
- [ ] C6 Real `LightEngine`: intensity formula, pulse, phase drift, idle breathing, silence fade, Visibility, `IsStatic`
- [ ] C7 Settings validation/clamping, JSON store (atomic, backup on corruption), version migration scaffold, Presets
- [ ] C8 CI: `ci.yml` (Linux job: Core.slnf build+test; Windows job: full sln build+test), labeler, `.github/release.yml`
- [ ] C9 Packaging: `build/pack.ps1` (Velopack, x64+ARM64, self-contained), `release.yml` on tag `v*` with `vpk upload github`, optional signing step gated on secrets
- [ ] C10 `tools/icon-gen`: SVG → multi-size `.ico` + PNGs (consumes `assets/icon.svg` from Lane B)
- [ ] C11 Community health files + issue/PR templates + CHANGELOG
- [ ] C12 Perf + soak harness in Bench: run analyzer + light engine for 8 simulated hours of synthetic audio, and report allocations, p99 frame cost, and memory
- [ ] C13 Delete `Fakes/` and make `CoreFactory` return the real implementations. Final Core API docs (`docs/CORE-API.md`).

### C1 completion log

- [x] C1 FFT, Hann window, band analyzer, auto-gain, envelopes — PR [#2](https://github.com/sussyswimmer/bordervisualizer/pull/2) — effort: M. Completes the C1 item in the initial checklist above.
- Added internal audio building blocks and a zero-allocation `AudioFrontEnd`; C2 owns beat/silence detection, diagnostics integration, live tuning and the `CoreFactory.CreateAnalyzer` switch. Frozen contracts and every Lane B file remain unchanged.
- Spec clarifications: periodic Hann (`N` denominator), unnormalized forward FFT and one-sided magnitudes including DC/Nyquist; bands are [30,150), [150,2000), [2000,12000] Hz, clipped to available bins. Auto-gain peak decays in linear amplitude, floor tracks dB; leading exact silence does not initialize the floor, and the first positive sample initializes it to that sample's dB value. Initial sample history is zero-padded on the left. Empty input retains history; no-packet timeout belongs to C2. A sample-rate change resets history and envelopes.
- Validation: `dotnet build Rimlight.Core.slnf -c Release` — 0 warnings/errors; `dotnet test Rimlight.Core.slnf -c Release --no-build --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` — 33 passed, 0 failed/skipped. Tests were written before implementation and initially failed compilation because the new types did not exist.
- Accuracy: independent DFT maximum component error 5.548456e-7 (N=8/32); Hann FFT peaks at the exact tested bins (3/64/511, N=2048); Parseval relative error 6.203781e-8. For the same modulated three-tone signal at 0 and -20 dB after 2 s warmup, maximum Level/Bass difference is 3.576279e-7 at 48 kHz and 2.980232e-7 at 44.1 kHz. Envelope attack/release reaches the expected 63.212%/36.788% response at one time constant.
- Informational timing on this Linux cloud machine, .NET SDK 8.0.425 Release: 53,842.7 ns/frame and **0 bytes/frame**, 48 kHz, 800 samples/frame, N=2048, 2,000 warmup + 1,000 measured frames. This measures the C1 front end only, excluding signal generation; it is not a latency guarantee or the C3/C12 benchmark harness. No real-DSP baseline or BPM accuracy applies before C2.

- C1 review fixes (made by Claude Code on Maxwell's instruction, because Codex had not picked up the Lane B review of #2):
  - **Near-silence hold:** auto-gain freezes its floor while the quietest quarter of the analysis window is at or below `SilenceThresholdDb` − 20 dB (−80 dBFS), and on zero or non-finite band values. The peak keeps tracking and decaying as usual. Per-quarter gating catches the frames where a gap or the music only partly fills the window: Hann weighting collapses the band values there even though the whole-window RMS is high.
    - Gaps tested: digital-zero and −96 dBFS dither gaps starting and ending anywhere inside a hop, leading silence at any offset, and a quieter track after a 30 s pause.
    - Result: Level and Bass stay within 0.1 of an uninterrupted (or music-only) run from 2 s after resume; measured max deviation 0.000.
    - Quiet but real music above −80 dBFS keeps adapting as doc 03 describes.
  - **Non-finite input:** NaN/±Inf samples become 0 and finite samples are clamped to ±16 on entry to the ring, on all three copy paths. AutoGain and Envelope also ignore non-finite input, so one bad sample can't latch Level/Bass to NaN.
  - **Level weights** are independent live-tuning sliders (doc 03 §4). Lane B bounds each to 0..1 (doc 03 sets no range), so the sum-to-1 check is gone and the Level target is clamped to 0..1.
  - **Empty input** returns early instead of recomputing an identical spectrum (about 30 µs → about 0.5 µs per no-packet frame).
  - **Tests (63):** gap edges at varied offsets, leading silence, a quiet track after a pause, NaN/±Inf on every copy path, huge samples (spectrum finite, signal still tracked), the near-silence threshold and the quarter-RMS definition, irregular-feed allocations, and a hand-wired doc 03 reference pipeline with a dither gap (band, weight, tau and hold wiring). Mutation checks: the previous whole-window gate, a frozen peak, un-held mid/high gains and a missing clamp each fail at least two tests.
  - **Known limit, follows doc 03 as written:** a slow fade-out or fade-in, or a breakdown that empties one band (e.g. no bass for 15 s), still drops that band's floor by tens of dB. The next 20–40 s are then compressed toward 1 (Level ≈ 0.9 after an 8 s fade, against 0.46). Options for the sync point 2 tuning round: limit each band's floor relative to its peak, raise the floor faster when the value sits far above it, or hold a band while it is far below its own decayed peak.
  - **Left for C2:** the no-packet policy (stale window on empty spans), and bass resolution at 96/192 kHz with N = 2048.

- [x] C2 spectral-flux beat detector, silence detection, `AnalyzerDiagnostics`, live `AudioTuning`, real `IAudioAnalyzer` + zero-alloc tests (made by Claude Code on Maxwell's instruction while Codex was idle; stacked on the C1 PR) — effort: M
  - **Results (procedural signals only):**
    - Kick tracks at 90/120/128/174 BPM are found within ±0.6 BPM at 44.1 and 48 kHz with ±20 % frame jitter, and every expected beat is detected.
    - A music-like mix (kick, bass line, hats, pad, vocal tones) tracks at 124 ± 2 BPM.
    - There are 0 beats on 60 s of white noise at three levels (0 in 8 min across seeds during tuning), and 0 on silence or missing packets.
    - Beats are volume-invariant at −20 dB.
    - 0 bytes per frame across 800/735/0/1/2048/5000-sample feeds and sample-rate changes.
  - **Spec clarifications** (AGENTS.md standard 1):
    - **Flux units:** flux and `Diagnostics.Spectrum` are in amplitude units (|X|·4/N, so a full-scale sine centered on a bin reads ≈ 1). `MinFlux` uses the same units.
    - **Median onset guard** (`MedianOnsetRatio` = 10, internal): a beat also needs flux > 10 × the median flux of the history window. Without it, mean + 1.5σ fires several times a second on steady white noise, because the bass band spans only ~5 bins and its flux is heavy-tailed. Noise peaks at about 7.4× median, while kicks sit at ≥ 16× even under heavy noise. Sensitivity relaxes it like k: `1 + 9 / Sensitivity`. At Sensitivity 2, white noise gives about one false beat per 7 s. It could become an `AudioTuning` field at the next approved contract change.
    - **Warm-up:** no beats until a quarter of `FluxHistorySeconds` of flux history exists.
    - **Beat history:** frames without new samples add no entry to the beat history.
    - **No packets:** after `NoPacketTimeoutSeconds`, missing packets are fed as zeros, so the spectrum, auto-gain hold and `IsSilent` behave as for digital silence. Level never rises during a gap, and `IsSilent` arrives 0.1 s + 2 s after the last packet.
    - **`IsSilent`:** uses the RMS of each frame's new samples, entering below −60 dBFS after `SilenceHoldMs` and exiting above −55 dBFS.
    - **Sensitivity:** applied once, in the analyzer. It divides k and the onset ratio and multiplies Level (clamped to 0..1). C6 must not apply it again (H-007).
    - **Diagnostics:** one history entry per `Process` call, oldest first. `EstimatedBpm` is the median of the last 16 beat intervals up to 2 s. A `WindowSize` change reallocates inside the `Tuning` setter, resets, and replaces `Diagnostics`. Invalid tuning throws and keeps the previous value. A non-finite or negative dt is treated as 0.
  - **Factory and fakes:** `CoreFactory.CreateAnalyzer` now returns `AudioAnalyzer`, and `FakeAnalyzer` is deleted. `FakeLightEngine` now uses Brightness × (0.35 + 0.65 × Level), so the glow keeps its floor with the real analyzer until C6 (H-007).

- [ ] K12 `assets/icon.svg`, `assets/banner.svg/png`, README, repo settings text for Maxwell, recording instructions

## K0 notes

- Contracts are defined by doc 09 §3; source specs are unchanged. `AudioTuning` and `AnalyzerDiagnostics` are data containers, not DSP implementations. Doc 03 does not specify a numeric `minFlux`; K0 uses a provisional 0.01 pending C2 tuning.
- Palette-blender and settings-store fakes complete the five factory methods; they deliberately provide immediate palette changes and in-memory settings only. `Presets.All` remains a C7 placeholder.
- CI belongs to C8 under doc 09 and is not included. The solution filter includes Core + Tests; Bench arrives in C3.
- Windows tray startup and Quit require manual validation on Windows; Linux can only cross-build them.
- Verified with .NET SDK 8.0.425 on Linux: `dotnet build Rimlight.Core.slnf -c Release` and `dotnet build Rimlight.sln -c Release` both pass with 0 warnings / 0 errors. Both solution-filter and full-solution test runs pass: 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
- H.NotifyIcon.Wpf is pinned to 2.3.2 (includes .NET 8 assets); 2.4.1 targets .NET 10. No DSP accuracy or performance figures apply to K0 fakes.
- Manual Windows check pending: run `dotnet run --project src/Rimlight.App -c Release`, verify the purple placeholder tray icon and tooltip, then choose “Quit Rimlight”; the icon and process should exit cleanly.
